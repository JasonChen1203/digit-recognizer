# digit-recognizer

Handwritten digit recognizer built using Keras and Tensorflow, and trained with 60,000 images from the MNIST dataset. Here, without getting too technical, I'll briefly explain my model and some of the techniques used to improve its accuracy.

## Convolutional Neural Network
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of neural network most often used in computer vision (i.e. interpreting & understanding the visual world, such as an image). An image can be broken down into a series of pixel values that indicates its colors and brightness, and we can use this to identify objects, and in our case, handwritten digits.

Below is an examplar of the architecture of a CNN:
